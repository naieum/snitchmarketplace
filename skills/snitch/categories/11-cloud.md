## CATEGORY 11: Cloud Security

### Detection
- Cloud SDKs: `aws-sdk`, `@aws-sdk/*`, `@google-cloud/*`, `@azure/*`
- Infrastructure-as-code: Terraform (`.tf`), CloudFormation, Pulumi files
- Cloud environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

### What to Search For
- Cloud credentials in code
- Overly permissive IAM policies
- Open security groups
- Service account keys in repo

### Actually Vulnerable
- IAM with wildcard action AND resource
- Security groups open to 0.0.0.0/0 on sensitive ports
- Hardcoded cloud credentials
- Service account JSON committed

### NOT Vulnerable
- Constrained IAM policies
- Web ports open to public
- Secret manager references

### Context Check
1. Is the IAM policy scoped to specific resources or using wildcards?
2. Is the security group for a web server (80/443) or sensitive service?
3. Are credentials in code or loaded from a secret manager?

### Files to Check
- `**/*.tf`, `**/cloudformation*.yml`, `**/pulumi*.ts`
- `**/iam*.json`, `**/policy*.json`
- `.env*`, `**/credentials*`, `**/serviceaccount*`
