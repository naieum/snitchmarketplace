## CATEGORY 4: Authentication Issues

### Detection
- Auth libraries: `jsonwebtoken`, `passport`, `express-session`, `next-auth`, `@clerk/nextjs`, `better-auth`
- JWT usage: `jwt.sign`, `jwt.verify`, `jose` imports
- Session/cookie configuration patterns

### What to Search For
- Routes without auth middleware
- JWT signing with weak secrets
- JWT allowing none algorithm
- Insecure cookie settings
- Hardcoded session secrets
- Open redirects: `redirect()`, `res.redirect()` using `returnUrl`, `next`, `redirect_to` query params without allowlist validation
- WebSocket connections: `wss.on('connection', (ws) => { ... })` handlers that process messages before verifying authentication

### Actually Vulnerable
- Admin routes with no authentication middleware
- JWT secrets that are short or obvious
- Accepting none as a valid JWT algorithm
- Cookies without secure flag in production
- Session secrets hardcoded as simple strings
- `redirect(req.query.returnUrl)` without validating the URL is same-origin or on an allowlist
- `res.redirect(req.body.next)` after login with no URL validation
- WebSocket connection handler that processes data without checking session/JWT on the initial upgrade request

### NOT Vulnerable
- Routes with auth middleware applied
- Public routes that should be public
- JWT secrets loaded from environment
- Development-only insecure settings with env checks
- Redirect URLs validated against a same-origin check or explicit allowlist
- Auth provider handling redirects (Clerk, Auth0 handle this internally)
- WebSocket handlers that validate auth token from query params or headers on the `connection` event before any processing

### Context Check
1. Is middleware applied at router level?
2. Should this route be public?
3. Is insecure setting guarded by environment check?

### Files to Check
- `middleware.ts`, `**/auth/**`, `**/session/**`
- `pages/api/**`, `app/api/**`, `**/routes/**`
- JWT and session configuration files
